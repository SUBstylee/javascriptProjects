<!--
Buttons that play sounds when clicked. Uses the HTML Audio API to play sounds,
and the Document Fragment API to create audio and button elements dynamically.
The audio elements are created in a loop, and appended to the document body. The
buttons are also created in a loop, and appended to a div with the id "buttons".
The audio elements are paused and reset when a new sound is played, to prevent
multiple sounds from playing at once.
